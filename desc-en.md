--- Technical Infos about me ---

- PhaserJS (Personal Projects) -
My main tool. Developed a full featured MMORPG based in pok√©mon (open source) with high advanced scripting system and personal scripting language, similar to RPG Maker features. In long term I'll turn my game into a (MMO)RPG Game Framework/Engine with game templates for turn based (MMO)RPG games, action (MMO)RPG games, it will also include a visual script language on top of JSON like Blueprint of Unreal Engine, Construct, GDevelop and another visual scripting langs. The Game Engine itself have it owns art feature using LPC art collections from opengameart and automated characters spritesheet frames, it owns UI Builder, and as "master" trick it will use AI to make games (sprites, sounds, storyline and etc via prompts). In long terms I will do a "full stack" code that developer can build a MMO game writing the same code in both client and server, something similar that NextJS and NuxtJS did to ReactJS and VueJS.

- Gambling Games -
Good experience with gambling/cassino web-based (PhaserJS, Canvas, WebGL) games: 
Worked for a cassino video bingo (in person) game studio and developed and maintenence a game framework built on top of PhaserJS to manage game templates on top of it, I also developed a Debug GUI Tool to make more easy the development and maintenence, bring new ideas about engineering and optimizations in game spefic behaviors, also created some python scripts to artists team that they can do some automatations with arts patterns. Developed a multiplayer online checkers game for a bet company. 
Developed from scratch a a Multiplayer Online Gambling Checkers Game with PhaserJS: Real-time player interaction with room and/or channel systems using network events, websockets, matchmaking and authoritative server with clean and organized proprietary architecture based on Entity-Rule-Manager with a well coded event system in the gameloop and gameflow.
Developed a Cassino BlackJack game using a robust and clean architecture focusing in long term maintenance and good to read code. (PixiJS)
Developed a Coin Flip minigame for a side-games collection of a NFT games company. (PhaserJS)

- Full stack web and app development -
 VueJS, ReactJS, NuxtJS, NextJS, NestJS, Express, SocketIO, Colyseus, PHP, jQuery, Bootstrap, TailWindCSS, mobile and other main and generalist web tools. And other game engines/frameworks. So I can git well any king of web development framework to web games development that need to be in a dashboard or web rendering. Also have sense about Laravel, .Dot Net, Spring Boot and other generalist BackEnd frameworks that is very closer to NestJS.
