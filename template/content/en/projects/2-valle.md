techInfoList:
    - "On the front-end, working with VueJS for the dashboard and PhaserJS for the game client."
    - "On the back-end, using NodeJS with ExpressJS and SocketIO, for the MySQL and RethinkDB databases."
    - "For mobile support, Cordova (NativeScript was discarded due to WebGL support) and for desktop, Electron."
    - "Implemented a `scripting language` built on top of JSON to automate the game client/game server; most of the game is fully automated, including level design, UIs, battles, and network processes. A proprietary architectural pattern was created to make development and maintenance easy and clear. Created creative solutions that saved many months of manual work, making the game easily customizable, similar to engines like Construct, RPG Maker, and GDevelop. Implemented many creative solutions involving dynamic loading for game optimization."
    - "Currently working on a new version of the game using TypeScript, PhaserJS 3, NuxtJS, NestJS, SocketIO, TypeORM, and JWT."
