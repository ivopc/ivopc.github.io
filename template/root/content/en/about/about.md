Hello! My name is Ivo, and I was born in São Paulo. I began to love computers and video games during my childhood and always had an interest in understanding how everything works.

When I was 12 years old, I had my first encounters with programming languages, and by the time I turned 13, I discovered and created a powerful tool in a popular online game that influenced hundreds of thousands of players in the game. At the age of 18, I started approaching all of this as a profession and began working in web and game development.
