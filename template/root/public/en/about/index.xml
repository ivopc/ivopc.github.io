      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;Hello! My name is Ivo, and I was born in SÃ£o Paulo. I began to love computers and video games during my childhood and always had an interest in understanding how it works.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;When I was 12 years old, I had my first experience with programming languages, and when I turned 13, I discovered and created a powerful tool in a popular online game that influenced hundreds of thousands of players in the game. At the age of 18, I started to face all of this as a profession and began working in web and game development as well.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
