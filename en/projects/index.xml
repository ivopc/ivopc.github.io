      <description>Monster Valle is a complete MMORPG game with turn-based battles and collectible monsters. The game has significantly contributed to my professional reputation and has opened doors to international opportunities. Notable game mechanics: battle, farming, PvP, player market, quests, real-time multiplayer interactions, monster attack learning and leveling up, party, items, storyline, RPG systems in general, etc. The old version, currently available for testing the game for non-commercial purposes and with some bugs, has become open-source, and its code is available here.</description>
