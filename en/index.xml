      <description>Hello! My name is Ivo, and I was born in SÃ£o Paulo. I began to love computers and video games during my childhood and always had an interest in understanding how it works. When I was 12 years old, I had my first experience with programming languages, and when I turned 13, I discovered and created a powerful tool in a popular online game that influenced hundreds of thousands of players in the game.</description>
